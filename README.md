<h3>💪 Lover of Strongly Typed Languages </h3>

# Background

I am a Junior Software Developer with a love of strongly typed code and problem solving. After a previous career as a Screenwriter represented by The Artists Partnership, AI came for my job so I decided to come for AI’s job. 

📚 Earlier this year, I was selected for Code First Girls' software bootcamp out of 3000 applicants, where I formalised my understanding of `OOP`, `Python`, `MySQL`, `Javascript`, `HTML` and `CSS`. I graduated with a Distinction and 98% across all assignments/tests. I then completed a follow on +Masters in `Java` and `Spring Boot` where I gained a love of strongly typed languages. 

🤓 I am currently undertaking an intensive bootcamp in `C#` and `.Net` with Northcoders where I am expanding my skill set and further preparing myself for career in coding. 

🔜 I am working on several personal projects with an aim of taking them to deployment (see below)
