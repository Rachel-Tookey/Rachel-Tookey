# 💾 AboutMe()

<h4>I am a Junior Software Developer with a love of strongly typed languages and problem solving. After a previous career as a Screenwriter represented by The Artists Partnership, AI came for my job so I decided to come for AI’s job.<h4>

<h4>Last year, I was selected for Code First Girls' software bootcamp out of 3000 applicants, where I formalised my understanding of `OOP`, `Python`, `MySQL`, `Javascript`, `HTML` and `CSS`. I graduated with a Distinction and 98% across all assignments/tests. I then completed a follow on +Masters in `Java` and `Spring Boot`.</h4>

<h4>I am currently undertaking an intensive bootcamp in `C#` where I am expanding my skill set and further preparing myself for career in coding.</h4>
