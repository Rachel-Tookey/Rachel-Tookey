# ✨ About Me

I am a Junior Software Developer with a love of strongly typed languages and problem solving. After a previous career as a Screenwriter represented by The Artists Partnership, AI came for my job so I decided to come for AI’s job.

Last year, I was selected for Code First Girls' software bootcamp out of 3000 applicants, where I formalised my understanding of <code>OOP</code>, <code>Python</code>, <code>MySQL</code>, <code>Javascript</code>, <code>HTML</code> and <code>CSS</code>. I graduated with a Distinction and 98% across all assignments/tests, and then completed a follow on +Masters in <code>Java</code> and <code>Spring Boot</code>.

I am currently undertaking an intensive bootcamp in <code>C#</code> where I am exploring the world of <code>.NET</code> and further preparing myself for a career in coding.

<h6><i>My Humblebrag:</i> I have a First class degree in Law from Cambridge. I'm sure someday it will come in handy...</h6>
